It&#8217;s a dubious skill, but one nonetheless: I&#8217;m pretty good at crashing parties. Some of the highlights include meeting Ron Jeremy in the VIP of Filmore&#8217;s; Rosedale pool party with Shawn Hewson of *Project Runway*; a Bay Street law firm Christmas party, complete with free wine and live band. My latest was crashing a Fashion Week shindig at the One King West Hotel two months ago after leaving work late one night.

I don&#8217;t go looking to crash parties (mostly), but rather find them serendipitously. But when I do find something worth checking out, I do like the challenge of it.

So here&#8217;s my tips on how to make your evening a memorable one:

Rule #1: Assume you&#8217;re already invited. This is key. You can&#8217;t appear nervous or that you don&#8217;t belong or seem unsure. Just walk in, confident, like you&#8217;re part of the crowd. Don&#8217;t peak your head in or anything like you&#8217;re trying to get a look. People who are invited don&#8217;t do that. So just do the same and 90% you are good to go.

Rule #2: Start a conversation with the nearest person you see. I always try and do this. This is a corollary of Rule #1. It&#8217;s about blending in so spark up a conversation. Don&#8217;t just stand around. Talking with someone also gives you information about the party itself; in the case a bouncer or enforcer asks you what you are doing you can answer. Once this happened and I replied &#8220;I&#8217;m with Mike!&#8221; i.e., Mike the guy I was talking to. They left me alone after that.

Rule #3: Try and find a crowd. Sometimes you won&#8217;t get in the first time and getting in with another group can work. I find this less successful, but if you&#8217;re personable enough it can work.

Rule #4: If all else fails, find the back door. I almost never have to resort to this, but occasionally there&#8217;s a back entrance. At the One West the doorman wouldn&#8217;t let me in so I had to go around the hotel to the private elevator entrance (entering with an actual, unsuspecting guest) and just followed the music and walked in. I had to go up a few floors, but the music was loud enough that I knew which floor to get off of.

Happy crashing!
