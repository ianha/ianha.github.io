On April 18th, [Sprouter][1] organized their monthly [Sprout Up][2] event at The Courthouse. It&#8217;s a useful event for those interested in hearing about new startups in Toronto.

April&#8217;s keynote was from Matt Meeker, one of the founders of [Meetup.com][3]. Matt talked about the inside story of Meetup, how they got started and their journey. The best part of the evening.

Interestingly enough, as Matt was talking, I was reminded of my favorite Steve Jobs talk. It was a talk Jobs gave at age 26, before the Macintosh, Â at the [Academy of Achievement][4]. In the talk, Jobs defines innovation as &#8220;connecting two experiences together&#8221; and that true innovation could only be done by people who &#8220;go out into the world and get experiences outside the normal course of events.&#8221; I always loved this because it speaks directly to things I care about: Human experience over theory; courage; discovering a path that&#8217;s truly your own.

Matt talked about two transformative experiences: 9/11 and reading [Bowling Alone][5] by Robert Putnam. In &#8220;Alone,&#8221; Putnam describes the disappearance of community in post-industrial America. Where once Americans participated in at least one social event a week is now reduced to once per month. At the same time, Matt spoke of his first-hand experience of spontaneous community building that sprang immediately after 9/11. About strangers reaching out to others offering help right there on the street. So while America was moving further apart, there was still a craving for meaninful belonging.

As such, Meeker and his cofounders created Meetup to solve this problem. Meetup offered a platform for others to connect in a community again. In other words, Meetup was about connecting two experiences together.

Innovation is a funny word. We often think of it as a Eureka moment, a brief moment of brilliance, a falling apple&#8211;an apple with a mind and existence of its own. Matt Meeker&#8217;s story taught me again the importance of your own experience.

Sometimes the best ideas are not ahead of you, but right beside you.
