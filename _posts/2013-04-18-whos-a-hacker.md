To laymen&#8217;s ears, the word &#8220;hacker&#8221; or &#8220;hacking&#8221; means cyber-attacks, phishing schemes or other nefarious acts, usually based out of Nigeria and usually involving voluntary donations. I know, because my non-technical friends admit as much. Whatever the specifics, it means something bad. In the startup world, however, it means something good. Desired, even.

Today, tech job postings abound looking for &#8220;hacker ninjas.&#8221; Facebook&#8217;s onboarding includes a [six week bootcamp][1] inculcating new recruits to the &#8220;hacker way.&#8221; Online programming courses liberally use the word. Given the positive spin, what does it mean to be a hacker?

Hacking is an attitude, not a skill. It&#8217;s a certain way of approaching problems that is especially valued by startups. Why? Because if you were to sum up the hacker attitude it would be: Don&#8217;t ask for permission. Do the most valuable thing and ship, then iterate. When a startup doesn&#8217;t know its product/market/fit, time is everything.

Hacking values speed over perfection. It&#8217;s not about Gant charts and meticulously road-mapping product specifications. It&#8217;s about rapid experimentation by doing what you need to do to get product into the hands of actual customers. Thinking of a five month re-architecting of your database for high scalability? Forget it. Ship first and scale later. (This is essentially what Facebook did. Until they couldn&#8217;t ignore the problem anymore. This was also the [early attitude][2] of Google.)

Hacking values flexibility and independence over rules. This is where the spirit of the Lone Coder, probing and dismantling a computer system in the dead-of-night, holds true. A hacker never thinks, &#8220;This is not my job. This is not my area.&#8221; Instead, they are guided by curiosity and an innate tendency to fix things and make things &#8220;right.&#8221; Hackers have a strong aesthetic sense.

So next time you look to hire someone for your startup, you might want to ask: &#8220;Are they a hacker?&#8221;
